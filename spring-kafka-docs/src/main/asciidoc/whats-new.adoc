=== What's New in 2.8 Since 2.7

This section covers the changes made from version 2.7 to version 2.8.
For changes in earlier version, see <<history>>.

[[x28-kafka-client]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 3.0.0 `kafka-clients`

IMPORTANT: When using transactions, `kafka-clients` 3.0.0 and later no longer support `EOSMode.V2` (aka `BETA`) (and automatic fallback to `V1` - aka `ALPHA`) with brokers earlier than 2.5; you must therefore override the default `EOSMode` (`V2`) with `V1` if your brokers are older (or upgrade your brokers).

See <<exactly-once>> and https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-447%3A+Producer+scalability+for+exactly+once+semantics[KIP-447] for more information.

[[x28-packages]]
==== Package Changes

Classes and interfaces related to type mapping have been moved from `...support.converter` to `...support.mapping`.

* `AbstractJavaTypeMapper`
* `ClassMapper`
* `DefaultJackson2JavaTypeMapper`
* `Jackson2JavaTypeMapper`

[[x28-ooo-commits]]
==== Out of Order Manual Commits

The listener container can now be configured to accept manual offset commits out of order (usually asynchronously).
The container will defer the commit until the missing offset is acknowledged.
See <<ooo-commits>> for more information.

[[x28-batch-overrude]]
==== `@KafkaListener` Changes

It is now possible to specify whether the listener method is a batch listener on the method itself.
This allows the same container factory to be used for both record and batch listeners.

See <<batch-listeners>> for more information.

Batch listeners can now handle conversion exceptions.

See <<batch-listener-conv-errors>> for more information.

`RecordFilterStrategy`, when used with batch listeners, can now filter the entire batch in one call.
See the note at the end of <<batch-listeners>> for more information.

[[x28-template]]
==== `KafkaTemplate` Changes

You can now receive a single record, given the topic, partition and offset.
See <<kafka-template-receive>> for more information.

[[x28-eh]]
==== `CommonErrorHandler` Added

The legacy `GenericErrorHandler` and its sub-interface hierarchies for record an batch listeners have been replaced by a new single interface `CommonErrorHandler` with implementations corresponding to most legacy implementations of `GenericErrorHandler`.
See <<error-handlers>> for more information.

[[x28-lcc]]
==== Listener Container Changes

The `interceptBeforeTx` container property is now `true` by default.

The `authorizationExceptionRetryInterval` property has been renamed to `authExceptionRetryInterval` and now applies to `AuthenticationException` s in addition to `AuthorizationException` s previously.
Both exceptions are considered fatal and the container will stop by default, unless this property is set.

See <<kafka-container>> and <<container-props>> for more information.

[[x28-serializers]]
==== Serializer/Deserializer Changes

The `DelegatingByTopicSerializer` and `DelegatingByTopicDeserializer` are now provided.
See <<delegating-serialization>> for more information.

[[x28-dlpr]]
==== `DeadLetterPublishingRecover` Changes

The property `stripPreviousExceptionHeaders` is now `true` by default.

See <<dlpr-headers>> for more information.
