=== TransactionIdSuffixStrategy

A new `TransactionIdSuffixStrategy` interface was introduced to manage `transactional.id` suffix.
The default implementation is `DefaultTransactionIdSuffixStrategy` when setting `maxCache` greater than zero can reuse `transactional.id` within a specific range, otherwise suffixes will be generated on the fly by incrementing a counter.
See xref:kafka/transactions.adoc#transaction-id-suffix-fixed[Fixed TransactionIdSuffix] for more information.
