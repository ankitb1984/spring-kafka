[[x32-tiss]]
=== TransactionIdSuffixStrategy

A new `TransactionIdSuffixStrategy` interface was introduced to manage `transactional.id` suffix.
The default implementation is `DefaultTransactionIdSuffixStrategy` when setting `maxCache` greater than zero can reuse `transactional.id` within a specific range, otherwise suffixes will be generated on the fly by incrementing a counter.
See xref:kafka/transactions.adoc#transaction-id-suffix-fixed[Fixed TransactionIdSuffix] for more information.

[[x32-async-return]]
=== Async @KafkaListener Return

`@KafkaListener` (and `@KafkaHandler`) methods can now return asynchronous return types `CompletableFuture<?>` and `Mono<?>`.
See xref:kafka/receiving-messages/async-returns.adoc[Async Returns] for more information.
